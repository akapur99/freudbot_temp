Everybody dreams. Adults and babies alike dream for around two hours per nightâ€”even those of us who claim not to. In fact, researchers have found that people usually have several dreams each night, each one typically lasting for between five to 20 minutes. During a typical lifetime, people spend an average of six years dreaming.
You forget most of your dreams. As much as 95 percent of all dreams are quickly forgotten shortly after waking. According to one theory about why dreams so difficult to remember, the changes in the brain that occur during sleep do not support the information processing and storage needed for memory formation to take place.
Not all dreams are in color. While most people report dreaming in color, there is a small percentage of people who claim to only dream in black and white. In studies where dreamers have been awakened and asked to select colors from a chart that match those in their dreams, soft pastel colors are those most frequently chosen.
Men and women dream differently. Researchers have found some differences between men and women when it comes to the content of their dreams. A study showed that men's dreams tend to have more aggressive content and physical activity, while women's dreams contain more rejection and exclusion, as well as more conversation than physical activity.
Animals probably dream. Many think that when a sleeping dog wags its tail or moves its legs, it is dreaming. While it's hard to say for sure whether this is truly the case, researchers believe that it's likely that animals do indeed dream. Just like humans, animals go through sleep stages that include cycles of REM and non-REM sleep.
It's possible to control your dreams. A lucid dream is one in which you are aware that you are dreaming even though you're still asleep. Lucid dreaming is thought to be a combination state of both consciousness and REM sleep, during which you can often direct or control the dream content.
Negative emotions are more common. Over a period of more than 40 years, researcher Calvin S. Hall, PhD, collected over 50,000 dream accounts from college students. The dream accounts revealed that many emotions are experienced during dreams, though the most common emotion experienced in dreams was anxiety, and negative emotions, in general, were much more common than positive ones.
Blind people may dream visually. In one study of people who have been blind since birth, researchers found that they still seemed to experience visual imagery in their dreams, and they also had eye movements that correlated to visual dream recall.
You are paralyzed during your dreams. Basically, because motor neurons are not stimulated, your body does not move.
Many dreams are universal. While dreams are often heavily influenced by our personal experiences, researchers have found that certain dream themes are very common across different cultures. For example, people from all over the world frequently dream about being chased, being attacked, or falling.
